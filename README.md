# Liner Stands

A collection of files to create a simple liner stand out of a variety of materials.


## Usage

Files are organized by material and thickness. For best results measure your material first and choose the appropriate thickness. A test piece is included in each profile. When in doubt cut two copies and check the fit.

Currently the 3d printable version prints folded up. It needs to be unfolded and glue applied to the inside of the hinges. Normal superglue is ideal.
